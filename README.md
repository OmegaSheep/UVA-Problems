# UVA-Problems
My personal repository of solved UVA-problems. 

The majority of the problems solved here were done as course work for CMPUT 403: Practical Algorithmics. Citations are listed in the header of each problem by my primary reference source for the majority of problems was Competitive Programming 3 which is available at <a href=http://www.lulu.com/ca/en/shop/steven-halim/competitive-programming-3/paperback/product-21059906.html>lulu.com</a>
