# UVA-Problems
My personal repository of solved <a href=https://uva.onlinejudge.org/>UVA-problems</a>. 

The majority of the problems solved here were done as course work for CMPUT 403: Practical Algorithmics. Citations are listed in the header of each problem but my primary reference source for the majority of problems was the course textbook, Competitive Programming 3 by Steven Halim which is available <a href=http://www.lulu.com/ca/en/shop/steven-halim/competitive-programming-3/paperback/product-21059906.html>here.</a>

Problems are named according to problem number on the UVa Online Judge website. The two folders indicate how many points the problems were worth in my CMPUT 403 class (1 or 2 points), which was based on the percentage of users who could solved it. (80% solve rate boundary).
